# 🚆 Railway Management System (DSA Project – C++)

This project was developed as part of a **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course.  
It is a console-based system built in **C++** that simulates core railway operations such as train management and passenger bookings while applying fundamental DSA concepts.

---

## 📌 Features
- **Train Management**
  - Manage train arrivals and departures.
- **Booking System**
  - Passenger booking and management.
- **Custom Data Structures**
  - Implemented arrays, linked lists, and other structures to efficiently handle train and booking data.
- **Modular Design**
  - Organized with multiple header files (`Booking.h`, `Trains.h`, `TrainArrivalManager.h`, etc.) for scalability and readability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++  
- **Concepts Used:** Data Structures & Algorithms (Arrays, Linked Lists, etc.), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of **DSA concepts** in a real-world inspired system.  
- Improved **problem-solving** and **OOP design skills**.  
- Gained teamwork and collaboration experience with **modular programming** and **GitHub version control**.
